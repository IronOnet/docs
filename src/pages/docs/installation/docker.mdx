If you know docker, then you're lucky, we have shortcut road for you to
initialize development environment:
   
```
git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/
cd incubator-superset
# you can run this command everytime you need to start superset now:
docker-compose up
```

After several minutes for superset initialization to finish, you can open
a browser and view *http://localhost:8088* to start your journey. By default
the system configures an admin user with the username of `admin` and a password
of `admin` - if you are in a non-local environment it is highly recommended to
change this username and password at your earliest convenience.

From there, the container server will reload on modification of the superset python
and javascript source code.
Don't forget to reload the page to take the new frontend into account though.

See also [CONTRIBUTING.md#building](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#building),
for alternative way of serving the frontend.

It is currently not recommended to run docker-compose in production.

If you are attempting to build on a Mac and it exits with 137 you need to increase your docker resources.
OSX instructions: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#advanced (Search for memory)

Or if you're curious and want to install superset from bottom up, then go ahead.
