Install Database Drivers
-------------

Now that you have Superset up and running on your local machine, along with some example dashboards, let’s connect it to a database to run some queries and visualize some data.

Superset runs on Python and requires a database driver to be installed for each type of database. When setting up Superset locally via `docker-compose`, the drivers and packages
contained in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/master/requirements.txt) and
[requirements-dev.txt](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/master/requirements-dev.txt) will
be installed automatically. 

At the time of this writing, drivers for the following databases are included:

* [Druid](https://pypi.org/project/pydruid/)
* [Postgres](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/)
* [Presto/Hive](https://pypi.org/project/PyHive/)

If your database is one of these, you should be good to go! However, if you want to
connect to something different, like MySQL, you would need to install an additional driver. Here’s how you would do that.

### 1. Determine the driver you need

To figure out how to install the database driver of your choice, a good starting point is the [Datasource Connector section]( LINK TBD) of this documentation for instructions. If your database isn't on the list, please file an issue on the [Superset GitHub repo](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues), so we can work on supporting it. The [Superset community Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/apache-superset/shared_invite/enQtNDMxMDY5NjM4MDU0LWJmOTcxYjlhZTRhYmEyYTMzOWYxOWEwMjcwZDZiNWRiNDY2NDUwNzcwMDFhNzE1ZmMxZTZlZWY0ZTQ2MzMyNTU)
is also a great place for asking general questions about database driver installation and connection. 

In the end, you should be looking for a Python PIP package compatible with your database. One part that makes database driver installation tricky is the fact that local binaries are sometimes required in order for
them to bind properly, which means that various APT packages might need to be installed before PIP can
get things set up.

This tutorial will describe the process of installing a MySQL driver as an example. 


### 2. Install MySQL Driver 

As we are currently running inside of a Docker container via `docker compose`, we cannot simply run `pip install xxx` on our local CMD line and expect drivers to be installed for the containers to use. 

In order to address this, the Superset `docker compose` setup comes with a mechanism for you to install packages locally, which will be ignored by Git for the purposes of local development. Please follow these steps:

Create `requirements-local.txt`

```
# From the repo root...
touch ./docker/requirements-local.txt
```
Add the driver selected in step above:

```
echo "mysqlclient" >> ./docker/requirements-local.txt
```
Rebuild your local image with the new driver baked in:

```
docker-compose build --force-rm
```

After the rebuild is complete, which make take a few minutes, relaunch:

```
docker-compose up
```

### Step 3: Connect to MySQL in Superset What's Next

Now that you've got a MySQL driver installed locally, you should be able to test it out. 

We can now create a Datasource in Superset that can be used to connect to a MySQL instance. Assuming your MySQL instance is running locally and can be accessed via localhost, use the following connection string in “SQL Alchemy URI”, by going to Sources > Databases > + icon (to add a new datasource) in Superset.

For Docker running in Linux:

```
mysql://mysqluser:mysqluserpassword@localhost/example?charset=utf8
```  

For Docker running in OSX:

```
mysql://mysqluser:mysqluserpassword@docker.for.mac.host.internal/example?charset=utf8
``` 

Then click “Test Connection”, which should give you an “OK” message. If not, please look at your terminal for error messages, and reach out for help.
