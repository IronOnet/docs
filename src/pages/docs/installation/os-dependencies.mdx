OS dependencies
---------------


Superset stores database connection information in its metadata database.
For that purpose, we use the ``cryptography`` Python library to encrypt
connection passwords. Unfortunately, this library has OS level dependencies.

You may want to attempt the next step
("Superset installation and initialization") and come back to this step if
you encounter an error.

Here's how to install them:

For **Debian** and **Ubuntu**, the following command will ensure that
the required dependencies are installed: 

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev python-pip libsasl2-dev libldap2-dev
```

**Ubuntu 18.04** If you have python3.6 installed alongside with python2.7, as is default on **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS**, run this command also: 

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3.6-dev python-pip libsasl2-dev libldap2-dev
```

otherwise build for `cryptography` fails.

For **Fedora** and **RHEL-derivatives**, the following command will ensure
that the required dependencies are installed:

```
sudo yum upgrade python-setuptools
sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++ libffi-devel python-devel python-pip python-wheel openssl-devel cyrus-sasl-devel openldap-devel
```

**Mac OS X** If possible, you should upgrade to the latest version of OS X as issues are more likely to be resolved for that version.
You *will likely need* the latest version of XCode available for your installed version of OS X. You should also install
the XCode command line tools: 

```
xcode-select --install
```

System python is not recommended. Homebrew's python also ships with pip: 

```
brew install pkg-config libffi openssl python
env LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib" CFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include" pip install cryptography==2.4.2
```

**Windows** isn't officially supported at this point, but if you want to
attempt it, download `get-pip.py <https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py>`_, and run ``python get-pip.py`` which may need admin access. Then run the following: 

```
C:\> pip install cryptography

# You may also have to create C:\Temp
C:\> md C:\Temp
```
