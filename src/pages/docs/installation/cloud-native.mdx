Cloud-native!
-------------

Superset is designed to be highly available. It is
"cloud-native" as it has been designed scale out in large,
distributed environments, and works well inside containers.
While you can easily
test drive Superset on a modest setup or simply on your laptop,
there's virtually no limit around scaling out the platform.
Superset is also cloud-native in the sense that it is
flexible and lets you choose your web server (Gunicorn, Nginx, Apache),
your metadata database engine (MySQL, Postgres, MariaDB, ...),
your message queue (Redis, RabbitMQ, SQS, ...),
your results backend (S3, Redis, Memcached, ...), your caching layer
(Memcached, Redis, ...), works well with services like NewRelic, StatsD and
DataDog, and has the ability to run analytic workloads against
most popular database technologies.

Superset is battle tested in large environments with hundreds
of concurrent users. Airbnb's production environment runs inside
Kubernetes and serves 600+ daily active users viewing over 100K charts a
day.

The Superset web server and the Superset Celery workers (optional)
are stateless, so you can scale out by running on as many servers
as needed.
